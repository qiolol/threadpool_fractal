    // üêá++ Slightly faster
    // This partitions the image into rows of pixels and tosses all the rows
    // into the thread pool for threads to snatch up, process, and snatch up
    // more when they finish, until no more rows remain in the pool.
    //
    // This is even faster (slightly) since:
    //
    //     1. Some pixels get rendered faster than others
    //
    //     2. With row-by-row granularity, the workload is more evenly
    //        distributed among the threads
    //
    // The reason for 1 is that pixels that correspond to complex points which
    // escape the set right away are rendered very quickly, since they're done
    // once they escape. Call these "fast pixels".
    //
    // The reason for 2 is that rows replete with fast pixels are rendered very
    // quickly. Before, when threads were assigned large segments of pixels,
    // a thread that got a "fast" segment made up of fast rows would finish and
    // then be idle while threads that got "slow" segments kept crunching. With
    // row-by-row granularity, such idle threads instead pick up another row to
    // process.

    // üêá-- Less fast
    // This tosses all the individual pixels into the thread pool.
    //
    // Since finer (row) granularity was faster than broader (large image
    // segment) granularity, you'd think that *even finer* (pixel) granularity
    // would be faster still! But, actually, this is slower than row-based and
    // segment-based multithreading.
    //
    // I think this is because of all the access to the shared image. After a
    // thread processes a pixel (which takes very little time), it requests
    // access to the image to write the result, blocking the other threads. All
    // threads likely spend most of their time waiting for other threads to give
    // up their lock on the shared image than on actual work, resulting in a
    // slow-down. I assumed this slow-down would be so severe that this
    // approaches singlethreaded performance, but it's still about twice as fast
    // as singlethreaded.
