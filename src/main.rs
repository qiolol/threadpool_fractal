    // the set right away are rendered very quickly. Rows replete with such
    // pixels get processed very quickly. With row-by-row granularity, the total
    // processing time is more evenly-distributed among the threads than when
    // threads get large segments of pixels. Some segments may be full of such
    // pixels, and some not, so threads with "fast" segments that finish early
    // have nothing left to do while threads with "slow" segments keep crunching
    // away.
